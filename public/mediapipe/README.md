Copy MediaPipe face detection assets into this folder for offline use.

You can copy the folder after installing deps:
  node_modules/@mediapipe/face_detection/ -> public/mediapipe/face_detection/

The detector loads from:
  /mediapipe/face_detection

If you run the demo in TFJS runtime mode, you don't need this folder.
